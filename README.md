# JPush GO SDK
[中文文档](README-CN.md)

JPush GO SDK is the official Golang SDK for JPush, a push notification service. Since the official Go SDK only provides a project without any files, this SDK was developed to fill in the gap. Please refer to the unit test code for usage instructions.

## Feature List
+ Push API v3
+ Report API v3
+ Device API v3
+ Schedule API v3

## Unit Testing
1. Add APP_KEY, MASTER_SECRET, and REGISTRATION_ID to the environment variables.
2. Run `go test .`

## How to Use
Please refer to the unit test code for usage instructions.

## Note
The VIP class interfaces and Admin API v1 are not implemented due to lack of permission. If needed, you can submit a pull request.
